## Confidence Tagging

Every finding carries a tag: `[likely]` (evidence-based - code you read, official docs, observed behavior) or `[unsure]` (judgment, single-source, stale, or inferred). Both hedge - `[likely]` means "probably true, read carefully," not "certain."

- **Pre-flight agents**: report both tiers; `[unsure]` guides where to verify before planning. Consumers verify load-bearing `[unsure]` items before acting on them.
- **Post-impl reviewers**: `[likely]` unconditionally; `[unsure]` only at high impact (correctness, security, data risk).
- **Web-sourced** (plan-challenger, security-reviewer, researcher): `[likely]` = official advisory/CVE/maintainer page; `[unsure]` = blog/undated thread. Include source URL.
